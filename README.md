### Date completed: March 26, 2020.

### Introduction:


### Dataset
 [Kaggle]().

----
### Jupyter notebook 
The project was completed using a jupyter notebook that consists of 2 parts viz:

Part 1: 
 (i) Preprocessing and cleaning (ii) Exploratory data analysis

Part 2:
 Modeliing
 ----
 ### Visualizations in the dataset
There are three figures provided. These are visualizations created in the exploratory data analysis (section ii) of Part 1. All three 
visualizations were created using Plotly express. The charts have also been included as an image file with links attached.A summary of the each chart is provided below:

<div align="center"> Figure 2-Distribution of number of times users have assigned a score(s) to different products</div>
<br>

### Future work based on the dataset
 - Next step would be to explore the dataset with an item-based collaborative filtering techniques and also deep learning 
 to help in comparing the different models to see which performs the best.
