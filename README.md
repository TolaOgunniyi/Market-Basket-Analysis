### Introduction:
A key strategy for large retailers is finding the association between different items/products that are purchased by customers. Market Basket analysis lends itself to this particular goal via rules-based learning (i.e. associations rules mining)
Some of the goals that Market basket analysis can help retailers achieve are listed below:
- Recommend products
- Plan a store layout 
- Design sale promotions that combine discounted and marked up items.
- Dicover trigger products(products which when bought together, trigger other purchases)

### Dataset
 I used an Amazon electronics review dataset for my capstone project that I found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/saurav9786/amazon-product-reviews). The dataset contained over 1,000,000 rows. I extracted 600,000 rows of the dataset for my capstone project using command line as shown in the image below.

### Jupyter notebook 
The project was completed using a jupyter notebook that consists of 2 parts viz:

Part 1: 
 (i) Preprocessing and cleaning (ii) Exploratory data analysis

Part 2:
 Modeliing
 ----
 ### Visualizations in the dataset
There are three figures provided. These are visualizations created in the exploratory data analysis (section ii) of Part 1. All three 
visualizations were created using Plotly express. The charts have also been included as an image file with links attached.A summary of the each chart is provided below:
